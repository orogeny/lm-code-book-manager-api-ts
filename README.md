### User Story: As a user, I want to use the Book Manager API to delete a book using its ID

To delete a book, the user must send a DELETE request to the /books/:bookId endpoint

> DELETE /books/99

where :bookId is the numeric identifier of the book to be deleted.

#### Responses

##### Success

- 303 - See Other[^1]
- Location: /books

  If the book was successfully deleted the client will receive a 303 - See Other response plus a Location header containing the URL to the books collection.

##### Unknown BookId

- 404 - Not Found[^2]

If the bookId is numeric but was not found in the Book repository the client will receive a 404 - Not Found response indicating that no book exists with that id and no action was taken.

##### Invalid bookId

- 400 - Bad Request

- Body
  > message: "bookId must be numeric"

If a non-numeric book id was supplied the client will receive a 400 - Bad Request response with a message in the body indicating the problem.

Footnotes:

[^1]: A 204 - Done response was rejected as a client would not navigate away from the deleted book's URL.
[^2]: A 410 - Gone response was rejected as it indicates the id did previously exists which would necessitate tracking deleted book ids and ensuring they are not used again.
